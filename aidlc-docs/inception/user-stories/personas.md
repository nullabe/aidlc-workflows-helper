# User Personas

## Persona 1: Alex — The AI-DLC Adopter

- **Role**: Software developer adopting AI-DLC methodology on an existing or new project
- **Technical Level**: Intermediate to advanced — comfortable with CLI tools, git, and IDE configuration
- **Goals**:
  - Get AI-DLC rules installed quickly without reading lengthy setup docs
  - Have the rules placed in the correct folder for their specific agent (Kiro, Amazon Q, Cursor, etc.)
  - Keep their repo clean (gitignore generated artifacts)
- **Frustrations**:
  - Manual copy-paste setup steps are error-prone
  - Different agents use different folder conventions — easy to get wrong
  - Forgetting to gitignore generated folders pollutes PRs
- **Environment**: macOS, Linux, or Windows. Uses one or more AI coding agents. Works in git repositories.
